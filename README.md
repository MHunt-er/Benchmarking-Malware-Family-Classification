# Malware Family Classification Methods

## Datasets
Because of copyright issues, both the MalwareBazaar dataset and the MalwareDrift dataset just contain the malware SHA-256 hash and all of the related information which can be find in the `Datasets` folder. You can download raw malware samples from the open-source malware release website by applying an api-key, and use disassembly tool to convert the malware into binary and disassembly files.  
* **The MalwareBazaar dataset** : you can download the samples from [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/).  
* **The MalwareDrift dataset** : you can download the samples from [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/).

## Graphically Analysis of Table 4 and Table 5  
Here is a more detailed figure analysis for **Table 4** and **Table 5** in order to make the raw information in the paper easier to digest.

### **Table 4**

- **The classification performance (F1-Score) of each approach on three datasets respectively**
![classification performance](https://github.com/MHunt-er/Benchmarking-Malware-Family-Classification/blob/main/Graphically%20Analysis%20of%20Table%204%20and%20Table%205/table_4_1.png)

>The figure shows the classification performance (F1-Score) of each methods on three datasets. It is noteworthy that the Malimg dataset only contains malware images, and thus it can only be used to evaluate the 4 image-based methods.

- **The average classification performance (F1-Score) of each approach for three datasets**
![average classification performance](https://github.com/MHunt-er/Benchmarking-Malware-Family-Classification/blob/main/Graphically%20Analysis%20of%20Table%204%20and%20Table%205/table_4_2.png)

>The figure shows the average classification performance (F1-Score) of each method for the three datasets. Among them, the F1-score corresponding to each model is obtained by averaging the F1-score of the model on three datasets, which represents the average performance. The figure indicates that:
>>IMCFN in general achieves the best performance compared with the other image-based methods, similar to CBOW+MLP and MCSC for the binary-based and disassembly-based methods;
>>But there is no evidence that every best methods significantly outperforms the others within this category. The overall performance within each category is relativaly close to each other.
